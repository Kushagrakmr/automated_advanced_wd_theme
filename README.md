# automated_advanced_wd_theme

Trying to create a folder/repo where you can download this repo and then start working on your web-development asap. It is based on BEM which makes files easier to maintain and edit them later. There will be a lot of npm packages installed and it'll on npm them later instead of all the packages there will be a list of the package files which you can download from the package.json file. They are based on older version which might make them vulnerable or outdated but will try to update them.

# the list of npm packages which are used in here are
  gulp 
  gulp-postcss
  gulp-watch
  browsersync
  webpack
  normalize.css
  autoprefixer
  psotcss-mixins
  postcss-nested
  postcss-import
  postcss-automath
  
# the npm packages that might be used in future
  babel
